Marco Arment, setelah Trump terpilih:

>It felt hopeless. It felt like we’d never have a functional government again. It felt like the damage would be irreparable. It felt like the good side lost and would never win again.
>
>But then, in 2008, the good side won, propelled into victory by Americans’ motivation after those regressive and destructive years, and we had our turn for 8 years. It wasn’t perfect, and Obama didn’t (and couldn’t) fix everything Bush broke. But we did fix most of it, and made a lot of progress in major new areas as well. Overall, we came out way ahead.

Tapi dia tidak betul-betul _hopeless_. Kepada pemuda Amerika dia berpesan:

>In the meantime, do everything you can to help, support, and stand up for the millions of people whose country just let them down, many of whom live in homes and communities that have just become unwelcoming or unsafe.
>
>We’ll get our chance to repair the damage and move forward again, and you’ll bring us there.

_Good luck, America_.
