For Marco Arment:

>Having _only_ four USB-C ports is going to hurt the versatility requirement of pro gear, because there’s a very real chance that you won’t have the right dongle when you need it.
>
>This is going to happen a lot, because even though USB-C is the future, it’s definitely not the present. We’ve had the standard USB plug (USB-A) in widespread use for 18 years, and it’s going to take a few more years for USB-C to become so ubiquitous that we can get away without USB-A ports most of the time.
>
>A pro laptop released today should definitely have USB-C ports — _mostly_ USB-C ports, even — but it should also have at least one USB-A port.

Yes, at least __one__ USB-A.
