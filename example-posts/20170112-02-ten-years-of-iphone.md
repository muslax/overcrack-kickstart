Ulang tahun kesepuluh iPhone menghadirkan banyak memori. Dan berikut catatan yang dibuat Marco Arment (cetak tebal dari saya):

>Everything about the iPhone seemed impossible to the technology world of early 2007.
>
>*“You can’t make a good phone without buttons.”*   
*“You can’t fit a desktop-class OS on a phone.”*   
*“There’s no way that’s a full-blown web browser.”*   
*“That has to cost a thousand dollars.”*   
>
>Yet over the course of an hour, __Steve destroyed every rule we thought we knew__.
>
>Not only was it truly mind-blowing at the time, but in retrospect, _so much_ of modern computing was invented for the first iPhone and revealed to the world in that hour. [Just watch the software demos](https://youtu.be/9hUIxyE2Ns8?t=15m20s): most modern UI mechanics and behaviors, large and small, began that day.
>
>When it shipped six months later, it was possibly the best 1.0 in tech history, followed by a decade of relentless hardware and software improvements with the highest success rate and fastest advancement of any product line I’ve ever seen.
>
>I’ve seen a lot of major product launches and technology changes in my life and career so far, but nothing else I’ve seen has ever come close to the surprise, magic, and magnitude of the first iPhone, and I don’t expect it to be surpassed in my lifetime.

Happy birthday, iPhone.
