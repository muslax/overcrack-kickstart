Tentang Hiya, Truecaller dan Nomorobo:

>I had Hiya installed for weeks and it never identified a single spam call, during which time I got about ten. I followed all of their voodoo troubleshooting steps, but it just never worked, so I deleted it. (Too bad I can’t un-send them my contacts. Thanks a lot.)
>
>I had Truecaller installed for a few days, and it correctly identified two spam calls with no drama or voodoo required. It just works.
>
>When I learned about Nomorobo from readers and saw how creepy it wasn’t, I deleted Truecaller immediately and subscribed to Nomorobo, and it works great.
>
>A few days ago, after a 100% success rate for a couple of weeks — every spam call (and zero non-spam calls) identified before I answer — I enabled the option to send spam calls directly to voicemail.

[Nomorobo](https://appsto.re/us/KgPOdb.i) gratis untuk didownload, tapi Anda harus berlangganan Rp20.000 per bulan supaya fitur _spam call blocking_ berfungsi maksimal.
