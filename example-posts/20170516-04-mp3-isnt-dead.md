Kesimpulan dari tulisan panjang Marco Arment seputar narasi "MP3 is dead" ada di paragraf ini:

>MP3 is very old, but it’s the same age as JPEG, which has also long since been surpassed in quality by newer formats. JPEG is still ubiquitous not because Engadget forgot to declare its death, but because it’s good enough and supported everywhere, making it the most pragmatic choice most of the time.
